# dijkstra TS

A glorified dijkstra implementation(s) using TypeScript with multiple approaches, tests

### Setup
    
```bash
    npm install
```

### The entry points

* `appPrim.ts` creates a predetermined graph and generates the minimum spanning graph and then traverses several use cases with the shortest path    

### Graphing support
* I use [PlantUM](https://plantuml.com/download) to enable drawing graphs easily. You need to have [GraphViz](https://plantuml.com/graphviz-dot)
